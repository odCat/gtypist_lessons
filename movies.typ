*:SCI_FI_1
B:Quotes from Science Fiction Movies

*:SF_1_1

S:It's circular.  You exist to continue your existence.  What's the point?

*:SF_1_2
I:[2] Rama Kandra, "The Matrix Revolution"

*:SF_1_3
I:[3] Yoda to Luke Skywalker, "The Last Jedi"

 :That is the true burden of all masters.

*:SF_1_4
I:[4] Duncan Idaho to Paul Atreides, "Dune" (2001)
S:Dreams make good stories.
 :But everything important happens when we're awake.
 :Because that's when we make things happen.

*:SF_1_5
I:[5] Spoon Boy to Neo, "The Matrix"
S:Do not try and bend the spoon.  That's impossible.
 :Instead ... only try to realize the truth: There is no spoon.
 :
 :Then you'll see, that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.

*:SF_1_6
I:[6] Morpheus to Neo, "The Matrix"
S:There's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.

*:SF_1_7
I:[6] Morpheus to Neo, "The Matrix"
S:What is real? How do you define 'real'?
 :If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, 
 :what you can taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals
 :interpreted by your brain.

*:SF_1_8
I:[8] Morpheus to Neo, "The Matrix"
S:Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
 :What if you were unable to wake from that dream?
 :How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?

*:SF_1_9
I:[9] Agent Smith to Morpheus, "The Matrix"
S:Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world?
 :Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy.  It was a disaster.
 :No one would accept the program.  Entire crops were lost.
 :
 :Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world.
 :But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through
 :suffering and misery.  The perfect world was a dream that your primitive celebrum
 :kept trying to wake up from.

*:SF_1_10
I:[10] Agent Smith, "The Matrix"
S:Never send a human to do a machine's job.

*:SF_1_11
I:[11] Morpheus to Neo, "The Matrix"
S:The Matrix is a system, Neo.  That system is our enemy.  But when you're inside,
 :you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters.
 :The very minds of the people we are trying to save.  But until we do, these people
 :are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy.
 :
 :You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.
 :And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they
 :will fight to protect it.

*:SF_1_12
I:[12] Rey to Luke Skywalker, "The Last Jedi"

 :Inside me, that same force.

*:SF_1_13
I:[13] Cobb, "Inception"
S:What is the most resilient parasite? Bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm?
 :An idea.  Resilient ... hightly contagious.  Once an idea has taken hold of
 :the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate.  An idea that is fully formed -
 :fully understood - that sticks; right in there somewhere.

*:SF_1_14
I:[14] Eames to Arthur, "Inception"
S:You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.

*:SF_1_16
I:[16] Ariadne, "Inception"

 :with the physics of it.

*:SF_1_17
I:[17] Cobb to Ariadne, "Inception"
S:Remember, you are the dreamer, you build this world.  I am the subject,
 :my mind populates it.  You can literally talk to my subconscious.  That's one
 :of the ways we extract information from the subject.

*:SF_1_18
I:[18] The Architect to Neo, "The Matrix Reloaded"

 :this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly
 :efficient at it.

*:SF_1_19
I:[19] Merovingian, "The Matrix Reloaded"

 :prorgamming of the Matrix.  You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite
 :my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise
 :a harmony of mathematical precision.

*:SF_1_21
I:[21] The Oracle to Neo, "The Matrix Reloaded"
S:Because you didn't come here to make the choice, you've already made it.
 :You're here to try to understand *why* you made it.  I thought you'd have
 :figured that out by now.

*:SF_1_22
I:[22] The Oracle to Neo, "The Matrix Reloaded"
S:But ... look, see those birds? At some point a program was written to govern them.

*:SF_1_23
I:[23] Councillor Hamann, "The Matrix Reloaded"
